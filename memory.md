## Project State (2025-10-13)

- FastAPI backend serves static frontend and implements `/rain` endpoint.
- `/rain` endpoint accepts `lat`, `lon`, `horizon` params and returns rain status, message, and details.
- `/rain` endpoint is fully integrated with Open-Meteo API and applies correct rain logic.
- Endpoint is fully tested (param validation, structure, rain logic, and real API integration) with pytest.
- Output is verified to match Open-Meteo API data and logic.

### Frontend MVP (Phase 3)
- Static HTML frontend uses Tailwind (via CDN) for modern layout and transitions
- Geolocation via `navigator.geolocation` with robust fallback for denied/missing location
- Fetches `/rain` endpoint and displays result with humor
- Background color updates per rain condition (rain, maybe, no_rain)
- All UI is centered and responsive
- All Phase 3 TODOs are complete
