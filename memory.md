## Project State (2025-10-13)

- **Phase 6 complete:** Humor response system is now fully externalized and dynamic.
- `data/messages.json` holds all humorous responses for each rain condition (`rain`, `maybe`, `no_rain`).
- Backend loads messages from this file on every `/rain` request, so updates are live with no restart needed.
- `/rain` endpoint returns a random message for the detected condition, and the frontend displays it prominently.
- Manual city input, geolocation, and time horizon selection are all fully integrated and tested.
- All logic and endpoints are covered by tests, including test isolation for messages.

**Next:** Phase 7 (visitor counter and persistence).
