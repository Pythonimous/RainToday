# UF-403 â€” Background Color - Transitions Between Conditions

## Goal
Update the background color correctly when sequential checks return different conditions.

## Actors
- Visitor performing multiple weather checks in one session.

## Preconditions
- At least one weather check has already completed.

## Steps
1. Run a weather check that returns condition A.
2. Run a second weather check that returns condition B.

## Edge Cases
- Rapid successive checks may overlap; only the latest response should apply.
- Browser caching must not retain old classes after navigation.

## Expected Results
- Background class updates to match each new condition.
- Previous condition classes are removed before applying the new class.
- Result message updates to match the latest response.

## Related Tests

## Notes (optional)
- Coverage complements the single-condition flows UF-400 through UF-402.
